Introduction
=====================================================

The Irish countryside is striking with its beautiful patchwork of different colored fields, divided by lines of shrubbery, and dotted with fluffy sheep. This project focuses on procedurally generating such a scene in a stylized manner, including mountains, farmland, water, dividing tree-lines, and sheep. To achieve this goal, we addressed three main challenges: how to generate a low-polygon triangle terrain mesh, how to color said mesh, and how to place additional models in appropriate locations in the scene.

We generated a greyscale filter-map indicating which areas should be rolling hills and which areas should be mountains, so that we could apply the appropriate terrain generation noise function to each of these areas to create the overall landscape. We generated a water plane separately, which intersected the rest of the terrain at the appropriate level. The mountains and lowland were shaded with a continuous coloring function, the water was colored shades of blue, and the fields were colored based on a mapping to a Voronoi diagram. Finally, we placed the sheep in the scene only within pastures of a specific color, and we outlined each field with trees by keeping track of triangle adjacency relationships within the farmland.

Topic Overview
=====================================================

    Procedural generation of landscapes is a powerful tool for creating virtual worlds to explore. It is possible to generate infinitely many different worlds, so it is important to make some careful design decisions early on which drive the selection of algorithms for terrain generation and coloring. Given that we wanted to create a stylized farmland scene, we had to learn about and implement 5 main techniques: flat shading, Delaunay triangulation, terrain generation using noise functions, Voronoi diagram generation, and continuous coloring functions.

    Most renderers try to hide vertices by interpolating between the normals of different triangles when shading to smooth over the edges. In contrast, flat shading colors each triangle just one color, which creates stylized low-polygon images that look good. Since most rendering frameworks combine the vertex and the normal at that vertex, the only way to allow adjacent faces to have different normals is to actually store multiple vertices at the same location so that adjacent triangles no longer share vertices.

    Mountains, valleys, hills, oceans, and other essential features of a landscape are all represented by variation in terrain height. Thus, the algorithm for computing terrain height is at the heart of procedural terrain generation. In this project, we make use of a core procedural generation technique: the noise function. Noise functions are smoothly-varying functions which produce more similar outputs for nearby input coordinates and less similar outputs for distant input coordinates. We create varied terrain through the addition of multiple noise functions running at different octaves and by exponentiating the resulting variable to push middle noise values towards the extremes. We then distinguish between the different biomes in our scene by running this noise function through a biome filter, which is created in a similar manner but using noise functions with a longer wavelength. [#Amit]

    ![Example of initial noise function](perlin.png) ![Example of Biome filter](biome.png) ![Resulting noise function](combinedNoise.png)

    Traditional heightfield terrain has a very obvious grid that makes the terrain's algorithmic source obvious. We sought to produce something that looks more varied and organic. To avoid using the grid, we first generate a point set that approximates the shape of the terrain, with more points in areas that had more complicated features. To determine this point set we use three techniques. In the threshold sampling we principally consider the contrast in surface normal slope between a triangle and its adjacent triangles. In importance sampling we choose a certain amount of points randomly that have low change in surface normal, to populate parts of the image that threshold sampling ignores. We also use random sampling to add variance to our point set by randomly selecting some number of points from the scene not picked up by threshold or importance sampling. We then use a point set triangulation algorithm to compute a three-dimensional mesh. This transforms the point set into a mesh that represents the terrain surface. Specifically, we use the Delaunay triangulation algorithm, as it tends to avoid "skinny" triangles which are less visually appealing. [#Bill]

     ![Generated heightfield](preSample.png width = 130) ![Threshold sampling](thresholdSampling.png width = 130) ![Importance sampling](importanceSampling.png width = 130) ![Random sampling](randomSampling.png width = 130) ![#Delaunay](delauney.png width = 130)

    We color the terrain mesh's triangles one-by-one. We consider both the slope and height of each triangle in determining its colors. Higher regions are snowy, lower regions are grassy, and more dramatically sloped regions are rocky. To produce fields with patches of different color, we refer to a colormap image. This colormap image is a two-dimensional Voronoi diagram with random seed points. Voronoi diagrams partition the plane into regions by nearest seed point. Visualized in an image, they are a bunch of apparently random patches. These patches of color correspond to fields in our scene. [#Rosetta] [#Dave]

    ![An example of a colormap used for coloring the fields.](colormap.png)


Design
=====================================================
Our App class has the general G3D app functionality and our custom GUI code which allows for easy adjustment of important parameters. The generate button in the GUI has a lamda function that generates and displays our terrain. The heightfield generation code lives in our Mesh class, which calls the Delaunay triangulation Python script to help with the geometry design. To color the terrain, the Mesh class runs the Voronoi generation Python script for the field coloring and calls on the ColorMapper class which handles the continuous coloring function. Throughout the coloring process, the Mesh class is also adding models to the scene using the exposed methods of the SceneFile class, which stores all data for the generation of the SceneFile. The Mesh class ultimately outputs OBJ and MTL files for the terrain heightfield and water plane, which are loaded by the generated Scene file. Once all of the terrain generation is completed, the SceneFile class is used to generate the Scene data file with all of its stored position data. 

By splitting our design into multiple classes, we are able to isolate and organize components that have different functionality. The App class is used across most projects, so that code is mostly general, leaving much of the heavy lifting to other classes. By having our terrain generation organized in one Mesh class, we make it easy to add this functionality to future programs simply by adding this class. Probably the most useful design decisions though were to separate the ColorMapper and SceneFile as their own classes. It is easy to imagine wanting to apply many different coloring functions to terrain in the future to create different types of images, so having the ColorMapper class provides the functionality to extend this class in the future to make many different types of ColorMappers, all of which can be easily slotted into our existing design flow. The SceneFile class was also hugely useful for adding models to the scene and will be useful on future projects as a component that can be slotted into any program. The helper methods we have included mean that you no longer have to deal with one massive block of text and can instead quickly access the components of the Scene file you want to change and add models to the Scene file easily from anywhere else in the program. All of these decisions combine to create a design which is not only functional for this project, but will allow us to use components from this project in future projects and extend components from this project to create different types of terrain.

Correctness Results
=====================================================

- **Figure 1:** Coloring by surface normal. Steeper areas on the mountains are blacker and flatter areas are whiter, demonstrating our ability to accurately calculate the surface normal for each triangle.
- **Figure 2:** Coloring by Y-coordinate. Higher areas on the mountains are whiter and lower areas are blacker, demonstrating our ability to accurately calculate the height for each triangle.
- **Figure 3:** Flat shading. The shading normals for all the points on a triangle are the same. Every triangle, as indicated by the mesh, is entirely one color.
- **Figure 4:** Procedurally generated Heightfield. This heightfield was generated using an algorithm, looks like terrain, and contains areas of rolling hills, areas of mountains, and areas of water. Simplified mesh. The triangles do not appear on a grid and are more concentrated in areas with lots of surface normal change that require more detail.
- **Figure 5:** Simplified mesh. The triangles do not appear on a grid and are more concentrated in areas with lots of surface normal change that require more detail.
- **Figure 6:** Patchwork fields. Each field has 1+ triangles, demonstrating our ability to combine triangles into appropriate fields.
- **Figure 7:** Tree placement. Trees are positioned correctly to outline each field.
- **Figure 8:** Sheep placement. Sheep are positioned correctly in the pasture-colored fields with their normal aligned to the surface they are on and their position not overlapping with other sheep or trees.
- **Figure 9:** A plot of the execution time (not including Voronoi diagram generation) versus the size of the generated area. It appears empirically that our program has linear run time. This makes sense, since our program performs several passes over the generated area, doing a constant amount of work for each point or triangle.
